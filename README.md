# React Photo Gallery

In this project I created a photo gallery with React.js and utilized the Flickr API for the photos. In this app a user can search for photos as well as click on buttons for a pre-selected group of photos.

This project is live on netlify [here](https://witzel-react-photo-gallery.netlify.app/)

To download the files and open the project in your preferred editor, create `config.js` file in the `src` folder, create a Flickr account and get a personal Flickr API key, then insert the API key into the `config.js` file in the following format:

```
const apiKey = 'YOURAPIKEY';
export default apiKey;
```
